# OsteoporosisPrediction

Welcome to my osteoporosis prediction project! This project served as my final project for my Linear Algebra for Data Science course at UF. I worked on this project with Eric Chao and Camila Djurinsky Zapolski. It was an amazing experience to work with them and this project would not have been completed without them.

For a more detailed description of our journey with the project, please see the final report document included in the repository.
